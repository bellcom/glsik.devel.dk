(2) The team leader must know who the coupling manager is during the procedure and how to contact him.<br />
The coupling manager</p>

<p><strong>74.</strong> Before the work procedure commences, the coupling manager must ensure that safety measures are put in place, cf. § 75. Until safety measures are put in place, the electrical plant is considered to be under voltage.</p>

<p><strong>75.</strong> When working on dead high-voltage plants, the following safety measures must be put in place:<br />
1) Full disconnection.<br />
2) Checking that the system is disconnected.<br />
3) Prevention of re-connection.<br />
4) Checking that the system is dead before endpoint earthing.<br />
5) Establishment of endpoint earthing.<br />
6) Checking that endpoint earthing has been completed.<br />
7) Update of the coupling diagram.<br />
8) Go-ahead to the team leader.</p>

<p><strong>76</strong> (1). During the performance of the work procedure the coupling manager must ensure that<br />
1) the connection equipment used for disconnection is protected from unintentional connection;<br />
2) signage warning that connection is prohibited is not removed before work is completed; and<br />
3) any endpoint earthings that are established will be maintained throughout the work.<br />
(2) During measuring or testing, paragraph 1 (3) may be waived.<br />
(3) When connecting or disconnecting measuring and testing equipment, paragraph 1 (3) may be waived where the relevant plant part has been earthed and shorted immediately prior to the connection of the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>The team leader</strong><br /><strong>77</strong> (1). Before work commences, the team leader must ensure that safety measures are put in place, cf. § 78.<br />
(2) The work must not commence until there is a go-ahead from the coupling manager.</p>

<p><strong>78.</strong> The team leader must ensure that<br />
1) a check is made that the system is dead before temporary earthing is implemented;<br />
2) temporary earthing is put in place;<br />
3) it is checked that temporary earthing is in place; and<br />
4) there is adequate provision of protective devices or warning signage, cf. §§ 103-109, to prevent plants parts under voltage from being wrongly perceived as dead.</p>

<p><strong>79.</strong> The team leader must not let work commence until all members of the work team at the work site have received the necessary directions in respect of<br />
1) the scope of the procedure;<br />
2) the boundaries of the work site;<br />
3) plant parts under voltage near the work site;<br />
4) the performance of the work; and<br />
5) the safety measures and protective devices put in place.</p>

<p><strong>80 </strong>(1). During the performance of the work, the team leader must ensure that<br />
1) the safety measures and protective devices put in place are maintained as long as the work continues; and that<br />
2) temporary earthings put in place pursuant to § 81 are maintained throughout the work.<br />
(2) During measuring or testing, paragraph 1 (2) may be waived.<br />
(3) When measuring and testing equipment is being connected or disconnected, paragraph 1 (2) may be waived where the plant part concerned has been earthed and shorted immediately prior to the connection of the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Earthing and short circuiting</strong><br /><strong>81</strong> (1). Temporary earthing must be carried out to the extent required by §§ 82-89.<br />
(2) Prior to the temporary earthing of a plant part as referred to in paragraph 1, it must be checked that the plant part is dead at the earthing point. The check must be performed on the cable(s) to be earthed and shorted.<br />
(3) Fixed earthing terminals may be connected without prior testing of the voltage at the earthing terminal if this can take place without risk to people.<br />
(4) The team leader must check that the required temporary earthing is deployed.</p>

<p><strong>82</strong> (1). In overhead line systems, open station plants and enclosed plants opened in order to carry out work, temporary earthing is required, cf. paragraph 2 and §§ 83 and 85 however.<br />
(2) Endpoint earthing may be regarded as temporary earthing if it is located sufficiently close to the work site that § 88 is satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>83. </strong>In the case of work procedures near overhead lines, it is permitted to omit temporary earthing if<br />
1) the overhead line is endpoint earthed and<br />
2) a distance of at least 1 metre from the cable is maintained during the work.</p>

<p><strong>84. </strong>For operating procedures on AC overhead lines with operating voltages above 60 kV, temporary earthing is only required on the phase(s) on which work is to be done, provided that<br />
1) endpoint earthing has been put in place;<br />
2) warning signage has been put in place on those phases in the work site not earthed; and<br />
3) there is no risk that the persons performing the work will come within 1 metre of the phases at the work site that are not earthed with any part of the body, tool, equipment or device.</p>

<p><strong>85.</strong> If temporary earthing is not planned for the plant's whole earthing and shorting current, endpoint earthing is also required.</p>

<p><strong>86</strong> (1). Before performing work in cable systems, endpoint earthing must be performed.<br />
(2) In addition, if the cable system is connected to sections of the overhead line system, temporary earthing must be established at transitions between the cable system and the sections of overhead line.</p>

<p><strong>87</strong> (1). The earthing points must be chosen so that no fuses or circuit-breakers between them and the work site are included.<br />
(2) If there are disconnectors between the earthing points and the work site, they must be locked in the closed position.<br />
(3) Earthing can be implemented by means of circuit-breakers in factory-ready plants designed for this purpose, provided the circuit-breaker is locked, so that neither electrical nor mechanical disconnection can occur.</p>

<p><strong>88</strong> (1). Temporary earthing must be located such that it is visible from the work site, cf. paragraphs 2 and 3 however.<br />
(2) Temporary earthing for a machine or transformer and associated coupling installation may be located in the coupling installation, provided that the machine or transformer and the coupling installation are sufficiently clearly signed to eliminate the possibility of mistaking them.<br />
(3) In the station space, temporary earthing may be located on the other side of a wall or floor structure if it is not possible to implement the temporary earthing at the work site.</p>

<p><strong>89</strong> (1). Earthing and shorting must be performed on both sides of the isolation point before isolation is undertaken, if<br />
1) cables are to be isolated during the work, or<br />
2) the work is to take place on both sides of the isolation point.<br />
(2) For cable work, earthing and shorting may be performed at the cable end sockets.</p>

<p><strong>Coupling dead high-voltage plants</strong><br /><strong>90</strong> (1). Safety measures and protective devices put in place must not be inactivated or removed before the team leader has notified all those involved in the work that these are being inactivated and that the plant part that has been dead during the work must now be regarded as under voltage.<br />
(2) If it is not possible for the team leader to notify everyone who has been involved in the work in accordance with paragraph 1, it must be otherwise ensured that there is no danger to people.</p>

<p><strong>91.</strong> After performing work on dead electrical plants, all persons who have been involved in the work must be informed that<br />
1) the work has been completed;<br />
2) the safety measures and protective devices put in place are being inactivated; and<br />
3) the plant must now be regarded as under voltage.</p>

<p><strong>92.</strong> Before the go-ahead is given to connect the plant part, the team leader must ensure that<br />
1) the safety measures and protective devices put in place are removed;<br />
2) tools, devices and unauthorised equipment have been removed from the plant part; and<br />
3) the plant's barriers and enclosures have been restored.</p>

<p><strong>93.</strong> Coupling must not take place until the coupling manager has<br />
1) received a go-ahead from the team leader and<br />
2) ensured that all protective devices put in place have been removed.</p>

<p><strong>94. </strong>After the work has been carried out, the coupling manager must ensure that the wiring diagram is updated in accordance with the electrical plant's current coupling conditions.</p>

To ensure that no person accidentally enters the danger zone, the following safety measures must be put in place for work at or near high-voltage plants under voltage, cf. § 129 however:<br />
1) establishment of the safety distance;<br />
2) implementation of screens, barriers or insulating covers;<br />
3) putting up warning signage.<br />
(2) Safety measures as referred to under paragraph 1 must be fixed and assigned by the supervisor or in an instruction.</p>

<p><strong>104</strong> (1). The safety distance for work on or near a high-voltage plant under voltage is calculated from the plant's uninsulated parts under voltage and is determined by providing a suitable addition to the distance DL according to the nature, duration and complexity of the procedure.<br />
(2) The safety distance must be determined by the supervisor in the context of the risk assessment, cf. § 47.</p>

<p><strong>105</strong> (1). Screens and barriers positioned within the specified safety distance from uninsulated plant parts under voltage must consist of sheets of insulating material with electrical and mechanical properties so as to provide, by themselves, sufficient safety for the voltages that could arise across the plant part.<br />
(2) Screens and barriers as referred to in paragraph 1 must be able to be erected and taken down without compromising the safety distance with any part of the body.</p>

<p><strong>106</strong> (1). Warning signage must be effected by means of signage consisting of<br />
1) warning signs with zigzags in accordance with the Executive Order on safety signage and other forms of warning; or<br />
2) a yellow flag with appropriate marking.<br />
(2) Warning signage must not be applied closer to uninsulated plant parts under voltage than the distance DV or the specified safety distance, cf. paragraph 3 however.<br />
(3) Before work on or near dead high-voltage plants, it is permitted to place warning signage directly on or close to the parts maintained under voltage if this is necessary for the signage to be effective, provided that<br />
1) warning signs made of insulating material are used;<br />
2) the signs are put up with a suitable insulating rod that satisfies the provisions for tools and devices under §§ 53-55; and<br />
3) the safety distance is not compromised with any part of the body during the erection and removal of the signs.</p>

<p><strong>107.</strong> The work site must be marked with<br />
1) suspended yellow/black tape or<br />
2) screens or barriers bearing warning signage.</p>

<p><strong>108</strong> (1). The team leader must appoint a safety officer before setting up and removing warning signage and implementing and removing protective devices. During the performance of the work procedure, the safety officer must monitor the person who performs the work and warn him if the safety distance is at risk of being compromised, cf. paragraph 3 however.<br />
(2) The safety officer must not participate in the performance of the work himself and may supervise a maximum of two persons provided they are working together to perform the work and are located in close proximity to each other.<br />
(3) For work procedures for electrical plants where parts under voltage are fully shielded using accessories that are built-in or were supplied with the plant in accordance with the supplier's operating instructions, there is no need for a safety officer.</p>

<p><strong>109</strong> (1). When erecting and removing warning signage and implementing and removing protective devices near dead high-voltage plants, Parts 13 and 15 shall apply.<br />
(2) When erecting and removing warning signage and implementing and removing protective devices near high-voltage plants under voltage, Parts 13 and 18 shall apply.</p>

<p><strong>126 </strong>(1). Work near high-voltage parts under voltage must be carried out by qualified persons.<br />
(2) The work itself can be performed by instructed persons under the supervision or monitoring of the team leader based on the risk assessment. However, this does not apply to short-term service work near high-voltage parts under voltage, cf. §§ 129-132.</p>

<p><strong>127</strong> (1). After the performance of the work, protective devices that have been put in place must be removed, cf. paragraph 2 however.<br />
(2) Protective devices put in place must first be removed once the team leader has<br />
1) ensured that tools, devices and unauthorised equipment have been removed from the plant part; and<br />
2) notified everyone who participated in the work procedure that the protective devices are to be removed.<br />
(3) If it is not possible to comply with paragraph 2 (2), it must be otherwise ensured that no hazard arises.</p>

<p><strong>128.</strong> The following work procedures are not subject to the requirements of §§ 67-68 and §§ 125-127, even though the work is carried out in the proximity zone around parts under voltage:<br />
1) work which may be carried out in accordance with § 43 (1);<br />
2) work in plants where parts under voltage can be fully shielded prior to the work using accessories that are built-in or were supplied with the plant in accordance with the supplier's operating instructions for the plant;<br />
3) working with or driving high-level machinery where compliance with a sufficient safety distance is ensured by means of equipment blocking off the machinery's area of movement or signage gantries on its transport routes.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term service work near high-voltage parts under voltage</strong><br /><strong>129.</strong> Where putting protective devices in place involves a relatively high risk, the following types of short-term service work may be carried out on the basis of a risk assessment without any safety measures other than compliance with a specified safety distance, cf. § 84 however:<br />
1) resetting and adjustment of devices intended for this purpose;<br />
2) checking the liquid level and insulating gases and replenishing these.</p>

<p><strong>130. </strong>Before the work procedure commences, the team leader must instruct everyone on the work team on<br />
1) the scope of the work procedure;<br />
2) the plant parts under voltage near the work site;<br />
3) the performance of the work; and<br />
4) the specified safety distances.</p>

<p><strong>131</strong> (1). If the risk assessment so requires, the team leader must designate a safety officer who monitors the person performing the work during the performance of the work procedure and warns the latter if the safety distance is at risk of being compromised.<br />
(2) The safety officer must not be allowed to participate in the work and may only supervise two persons where they are working together to perform the work and are located in close proximity to each other.<br />
(3) The team leader may himself be a safety officer as referred to in paragraph 1.</p>

<p><strong>132. </strong>After completion of the work, the team leader must ensure that<br />
1) tools, devices and unauthorised equipment have been removed from the plant; and<br />
2) the plant has been reconnected.</p>

This distance indicates the outer boundary of the danger zone.<br />
The distance depends on the operating voltage and is calculated in air from any insufficiently insulated part under voltage of the electrical plant.<br />
The size of the distance DL at the various operating voltages is shown in the table in Figure 1.</p>

<p><strong>At voltages other than those given in the table, DL can be determined by linear interpolation.</strong><br />
The distances DV (proximity zone)<br />
This distance indicates the outer boundary of the proximity zone.<br />
The distance depends on the operating voltage and is calculated in air from any insufficiently insulated part under voltage of the electrical plant.<br />
The area between the distance DV and the distance DL from a part under voltage of a plant is known as the proximity zone.<br />
Figure 1 Table of DL and DV distances.</p>

<p>Since there are no calculation methods for DC systems, the values for the DL and DV distance for AC systems are also used for DC systems below 500 kV.<br />
At low voltage, DV is set to 500 mm. At high voltage, DV is set to DL + 1000 mm if the rated operating voltage does not exceed 60 kV, and to DL + 2000 mm if the rated operating voltage exceeds 60 kV, see the table in Figure 1.</p>
