A. Technological knowledge, which can change rapidly, must be taken into account as far as possible and be utilised immediately.</p>

<p>B  For the devices referred to in Section 1, no. 2, the essential health and safety requirements apply only in so far as they are necessary for the safe and reliable functioning and operation of those devices with respect to the risks of explosion.</p>

<p>1. Common requirements for equipment and protective systems</p>

<p>1.0. General requirements</p>

<p>1.0.1 Principles of integrated explosion safety</p>

<p>Equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres must be designed from the point of view of integrated explosion safety.</p>

<p>In this connection, the manufacturer must take measures:<br />
– above all, if possible, to prevent the formation of explosive atmospheres which may be produced or released by equipment and by protective systems themselves,<br />
– to prevent the ignition of explosive atmospheres, taking into account the nature of every electrical and non-electrical source of ignition,<br />
– should an explosion nevertheless occur which could directly or indirectly endanger persons and, as the case may be, domestic animals or property, to halt it immediately and/or to limit the range of explosion flames and explosion pressures to a sufficient level of safety.</p>

<p>1.0.2. Equipment and protective systems must be designed and manufactured after due analysis of possible operating faults in order as far as possible to preclude dangerous situations.<br />
Any misuse which can reasonably be anticipated must be taken into account.</p>

<p>1.0.3 Special checking and maintenance conditions<br />
Equipment and protective systems subject to special checking and maintenance conditions must be designed and constructed with such conditions in mind.</p>

<p>1.0.4 Surrounding area conditions<br />
Equipment and protective systems must be so designed and constructed as to be capable of coping with actual or foreseeable surrounding area conditions.</p>

<p>1.0.5 Marking<br />
All equipment and protective systems must be marked legibly and indelibly with the following minimum particulars:<br />
– name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and address of the manufacturer<br />
– CE marking (see Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008)<br />
– designation of series or type<br />
– batch or serial number, if any<br />
– year of construction<br />
– for equipment group II, the letter ‘G’ (concerning explosive atmospheres caused by gases, vapours or mists), and/or<br />
– the letter ‘D’ (concerning explosive atmospheres caused by dust).</p>

<p>Furthermore, where necessary, equipment and protective systems must also be marked with all information essential to their safe use.</p>

<p>1.0.6 Instructions<br />
a) All equipment and protective systems must be accompanied by instructions, including at least the following particulars:<br />
– a recapitulation of the information with which the equipment or protective system is marked, except for the batch or serial number (see point 1.0.5), together with any appropriate additional information to facilitate maintenance (e.g. address of the repairer, etc.)<br />
– instructions for safe:<br />
– putting into service<br />
– use<br />
– assembling and dismantling<br />
– maintenance (servicing and emergency repair)<br />
– installation<br />
– adjustment<br />
– where necessary, an indication of the danger areas in front of pressure-relief devices<br />
– where necessary, training instructions<br />
– details which allow a decision to be taken beyond any doubt as to whether an item of equipment in a specific category or a protective system can be used safely in the intended area under the expected operating conditions<br />
– electrical and pressure parameters, maximum surface temperatures and other limit values<br />
– where necessary, special conditions of use, including particulars of possible misuse which experience has shown might occur<br />
– where necessary, the essential characteristics of tools which may be fitted to the equipment or protective system</p>

<p>b) The instructions must contain the drawings and diagrams necessary for the putting into service, maintenance, inspection, checking of correct operation and, where appropriate, repair of the equipment or protective system, together with all useful instructions, in particular with regard to safety</p>

<p>c) Literature describing the equipment or protective system must not contradict the instructions with regard to safety aspects.<br />
1.1. Selection of materials<br />
1.1.1. The materials used for the construction of equipment and protective systems must not trigger off an explosion, taking into account foreseeable operational stresses.</p>

<p>1.1.2. Within the limits of the operating conditions laid down by the manufacturer, it must not be possible for a reaction to take place between the materials used and the constituents of the potentially explosive atmosphere which could impair explosion protection.</p>

<p>1.1.3. Materials must be so selected that predictable changes in their characteristics and their compatibility in combination with other materials will not lead to a reduction in the protection afforded; in particular, due account must be taken of the material’s corrosion and wear resistance, electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, ageing resistance and the effects of temperature variations.</p>

<p>1.2. Design and construction</p>

<p>1.2.1. Equipment and protective systems must be designed and constructed with due regard to technological knowledge of explosion protection so that they can be safely operated throughout their foreseeable lifetime.</p>

<p>1.2.2. Components to be incorporated into or used as replacements in equipment and protective systems must be so designed and constructed that they function safely for their intended purpose when they are installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>1.2.3. Enclosed structures and prevention of leaks</p>

<p>Equipment which may release flammable gases or dusts must wherever possible employ enclosed structures only.<br />
If equipment contains openings or non-tight joints, these must as far as possible be designed in such a way that releases of gases or dusts cannot give rise to explosive atmospheres outside the equipment.<br />
Points where materials are introduced or drawn off must, as far as possible, be designed and equipped so as to limit releases of flammable materials during filling or draining.</p>

<p>1.2.4. Dust deposits<br />
Equipment and protective systems which are intended to be used in areas exposed to dust must be so designed that deposit dust on their surfaces is not ignited.<br />
In general, dust deposits must be limited where possible. Equipment and protective systems must be easily cleanable.<br />
The surface temperatures of equipment parts must be kept well below the glow temperature of the deposit dust.<br />
The thickness of deposit dust must be taken into consideration and, if appropriate, means must be taken to limit the temperature in order to prevent a heat build up.</p>

<p>1.2.5 Additional means of protection</p>

<p>Equipment and protective systems which may be exposed to certain types of external stresses must be equipped, where necessary, with additional means of protection.</p>

<p>Equipment must withstand relevant stresses, without adverse effect on explosion protection.</p>

<p>1.2.6 Safe opening<br />
If equipment and protective systems are in a housing or a locked container forming part of the explosion protection itself, it must be possible to open such housing or container only with a special tool or by means of appropriate protection measures.</p>

<p>1.2.7 Protection against other hazards</p>

<p>Equipment and protective systems must be so designed and manufactured as to:<br />
a. avoid physical injury or other harm which might be caused by direct or indirect contact<br />
b. ensure that surface temperatures of accessible parts or radiation which may cause danger are not produced<br />
c. eliminate non-electrical dangers which are revealed by experience<br />
d. ensure that foreseeable conditions of overload do not give rise to dangerous situations.</p>

<p>Where, for equipment and protective systems, the risks referred to in this point are wholly or partly covered by other EU legislation, Directive 2014/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres1)does not apply or ceases to apply in the case of such equipment and protective systems and of such risks upon application of that specific EU legislation.</p>

<p>1.2.8 Overloading of equipment<br />
Dangerous overloading of equipment must be prevented at the design stage by means of integrated measurement, regulation and control devices, such as over-current cut-off switches, temperature limiters, differential pressure switches, flowmeters, time-lag relays, overspeed monitors and/or similar types of monitoring devices.</p>

<p>1.2.9 Flameproof enclosure systems<br />
If parts which can ignite an explosive atmosphere are placed in an enclosure, measures must be taken to ensure that the enclosure withstands the pressure developed during an internal explosion of an explosive mixture and prevents the transmission of the explosion to the explosive atmosphere surrounding the enclosure.</p>

<p>1.3. Potential ignition sources</p>

<p>1.3.1 Hazards arising from different ignition sources<br />
Potential ignition sources such as sparks, flames, electric arcs, high surface temperatures, acoustic energy, optical radiation, electromagnetic waves and other ignition sources must not occur.</p>

<p>1.3.2 Hazards arising from static electricity<br />
Electrostatic charges capable of resulting in dangerous discharges must be prevented by means of appropriate measures.</p>

<p>1.3.3 Hazards arising from stray electric and leakage currents<br />
Stray electric and leakage currents in conductive equipment parts which could result in, for example, the occurrence of dangerous corrosion, overheating of surfaces or sparks capable of provoking ignition must be prevented.</p>

<p>1.3.4 Hazards arising from overheating<br />
Overheating caused by friction or impacts occurring, for example, between materials and parts in contact with each other while rotating or through the intrusion of foreign bodies must, as far as possible, be prevented at the design stage.</p>

<p>1.3.5 Hazards arising from pressure compensation operations<br />
Equipment and protective systems must be so designed or fitted with integrated measuring, control and regulation devices that pressure compensations arising from them do not generate shock waves or compressions which may cause ignition.</p>

<p>1.4. Hazards arising from external effects</p>

<p>1.4.1. Equipment and protective systems must be so designed and constructed as to be capable of performing their intended function in full safety, even in changing environmental conditions and in the presence of extraneous voltages, humidity, vibrations, contamination and other external effects, taking into account the limits of the operating conditions established by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>1.4.2. Equipment parts used must be appropriate to the intended mechanical and thermal stresses and capable of withstanding attack by existing or foreseeable aggressive substances.</p>

<p>1.5. Requirements in respect of safety-related devices</p>

<p>1.5.1. Safety devices must function independently of any measurement and/or control devices required for operation.<br />
As far as possible, failure of a safety device must be detected sufficiently rapidly by appropriate technical means to ensure that there is only very little likelihood that dangerous situations will occur.<br />
The fail-safe principle is to be applied in general.<br />
Safety-related switching must in general directly actuate the relevant control devices without intermediate software command.</p>

<p>1.5.2. In the event of a safety device failure, equipment and/or protective systems must, wherever possible, be secured.</p>

<p>1.5.3. Emergency stop controls of safety devices must, as far as possible, be fitted with restart lockouts. A new start command may take effect on normal operation only after the restart lockouts have been intentionally reset.</p>

<p>1.5.4. Control and display units<br />
Where control and display units are used, they must be designed in accordance with ergonomic principles in order to achieve the highest possible level of operating safety with regard to the risk of explosion.</p>

<p>1.5.5. Requirements in respect of devices with a measuring function for explosion protection.<br />

Conformity based on unit verification is the conformity assessment procedure whereby the manufacturer fulfils the obligations laid down in points 2, 3 and 5, and ensures and declares on its sole responsibility that the product concerned, which has been subject to the provisions of point 4, is in conformity with the applicable requirements of Directive 2014/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres.</p>

<p>2. Technical documentation</p>

<p>2.1. The manufacturer draws up the technical documentation and makes it available to the notified body referred to in point 4. The documentation must make it possible to assess the product’s conformity to the relevant requirements, and must include an adequate analysis and assessment of the risk(s). The technical documentation must specify the applicable requirements and cover, as far as relevant for the assessment, the design, manufacture and operation of the product. The technical documentation must contain at least the following elements:<br />
a) a general description of the product<br />
b) conceptual design and manufacturing drawings and schemes of components, sub-assemblies, circuits, etc.<br />
c) descriptions and explanations necessary for the understanding of those drawings and schemes and the operation of the product<br />
d) a list of the harmonised standards applied in full or in part, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and, where those harmonised standards have not been applied, descriptions of the solutions adopted to meet the essential health and safety requirements of Directive 2014/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, including a list of other relevant technical specifications applied.

<p>4. Verification<br />
A notified body chosen by the manufacturer must carry out appropriate examinations and tests, set out in the relevant harmonised standards and/or equivalent tests set out in other relevant technical specifications, to check the conformity of the product with the applicable requirements of Directive 2014/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. In the absence of such a harmonised standard, the notified body concerned decides on the appropriate tests to be carried out.<br />
 <br />
The notified body issues a certificate of conformity in respect of the examinations and tests carried out, and affixes its identification number to each approved product or has it affixed under its responsibility.<br />
The manufacturer must keep the certificates of conformity at the disposal of the national authorities for 10 years after the product has been placed on the market.</p>

<p>5.    CE marking, EU declaration of conformity and attestation of conformity</p>

<p>5.1.

<p>5.2. The manufacturer draws up a written EU declaration of conformity and keeps it at the disposal of the national authorities for 10 years after the product other than a component has been placed on the market. The EU declaration of conformity must identify the product for which it has been drawn up.<br />
A copy of the EU declaration of conformity must accompany every product, other than a component.</p>

<p>5.3. The manufacturer draws up a written attestation of conformity and keeps it at the disposal of the national authorities for 10 years after the component has been placed on the market.
