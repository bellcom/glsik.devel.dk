Sections 5-16 of this Executive Order.</p>

<p>   <em>(2)</em>. Where an electrical installation is not, or only partially, designed according to the version of the standard series for electrical installations applicable in Denmark, HD 60364, it must be documented that the safety requirement of Section 3 of the Electrical Safety Act, is met, cf.

Furthermore, normal use of electrical equipment may not represent a risk of burns to persons or domestic animals.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong>. An electrical installation must be protected against overcurrent so that persons, domestic animals or property are protected against the dangers that may arise due to excessive temperatures or electromechanical effects caused by overcurrent.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong>. Protective conductors, and any other part intended to carry a fault current must be able to carry such current without reaching excessive temperature.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong>. Electrical equipment, including conductors, must have mechanical protection against electromechanical effects caused by fault currents to prevent danger to persons, domestic animals and property.</p>

In case of extension or modification of an existing electrical installation by not more than two connection points, the protective conductor may be omitted if the existing installation does not have a protective conductor, provided that the extension or modification is protected by an RCD with a rated operating current not exceeding 30mA.</p>

<p><strong>64</strong><em>(1)</em>. In case of extensions or modifications in existing installations, socket-outlets with an earthing contact, which are part of the extension or modification, must be connected to a protective conductor.</p>

<p><strong>65</strong><em>(1)</em>. In an existing electrical installation, it is permitted to make a separate earth electrode without connecting it to the main earthing terminal if such a terminal is not included in the installation.</p>

<p><em>   (2)</em>. Exposed conductiveparts that can be touched simultaneously must, however, always be connected to the same earth electrode.</p>

<p><strong>66</strong><em>(1)</em>. In housing units, an existing electrical installation in a kitchen may be extended by up to two new socket-outlets without distributing these on two final circuits.</p>

<p><strong>67</strong>. Modifications are not permitted if they impair the safety of an existing electrical installation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Existing switchgear and controlgear assemblies</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>68</strong><em>(1)</em>. An existing switchgear and controlgear assembly that is a part of the electrical installation may be serviced, repaired, modified and extended within the existing exterior enclosure in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions and the requirements and provisions applicable at the time the switchgear and controlgear assembly was designed and installed.</p>

<p>   <em>(2)</em>. An extension outside of the existing exterior enclosure is regarded as a new switchgear and controlgear assembly which must be in compliance with the currently applicable requirements and provisions.</p>

<p>   <em>(</em><em>3)</em>. If an existing switchgear and controlgear assembly is moved, it must meet the requirements and provisions applicable at the time it is moved.</p>

<p><strong>69</strong>. If an existing switchgear and controlgear assembly that is covered by fault protection is modified or extended, the modification or extension must also be covered by fault protection.</p>

<p><strong>70</strong><em>(1)</em>. If an existing switchgear and controlgear assembly without fault protection is modified or extended within the existing enclosure, fault protection is not required for the modification or the extension of the existing switchgear and controlgear assembly.</p>

<p>   <em>(2)</em>. If an existing switchgear and controlgear assembly is extended by new switchgear and controlgear assembly sections, the extension can be protected by means of total isolation.</p>

<p>   <em>(3)</em>. Protection by automatic disconnection of supply may only be provided if protective equipment that disconnects the supply in case of faults is placed in the switchgear and controlgear assembly input or before the switchgear and controlgear assembly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fault voltage disconnection devices</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>71</strong>. Fault voltage disconnection devices may be replaced when the electrical installation is designed and erected in compliance with the provisions governing electrical installations at the time of design and erection or subsequent rearrangement.</p>

<p><strong>72</strong>. Protective conductors and earthing conductors for fault voltage disconnection devices may not be connected to the main equipotential bonding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Connections in electrical installations without a protective conductor</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>73</strong><em>(1)</em>. Class I equipment may be connected to an electrical installation without a protective conductor, provided that the installation is protected by an RCD with a rated operating current not exceeding 30mA.</p>

<p>   <em>(2)</em>. Electrical equipment where a protective conductor is required to ensure a proper safety function as well as electromedical equipment are not covered by subsection <em>(1)</em> above.</p>

<p>   <em>(3)</em>. The RCD requirement does not apply to an electrical installation with circuits where it is a requirement that a fault in one circuit may not impair the correct operation of another circuit and where the installation of an RCD would mean that this requirement cannot be met.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lighting installations in public areas</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>74</strong><em>(1)</em>. When repairing or maintaining lighting installations in public areas, the following must be used</p>

<p>i) luminaires or components that are identical to the existing or;</p>

<p>ii) class II luminaires or components or</p>

<p>iii) additional protection pursuant to Section 35 above.</p>

<p>   <em>(2)</em>. If the requirements in subsection <em>(1)</em> above cannot be met for luminaires or components, the part of the lighting installation in which such are included is to be regarded as a new part and must meet the requirements for new electrical installations stipulated in this Executive Order.</p>
